## The Repository

This repository contains starter code for a fully functional Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API that was refactored to into a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. This application allows users to search for books, create and login to an account to save and view books later, and delete books from the saved list.

This app utilizes a MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
